		<h2>What I do</h2>
		<p>My specialities lie between user-experience, web, app and visual design. My goal as a designer is to always be learning, growing and pushing the boundaries. What’s more, solving problems and connecting with the end user is what drives my passion for building products. I am happy working in collaborative environments on a constant feedback-and-iteration mode. In addition, I love to approach all design challenges by following the design process.</p>
